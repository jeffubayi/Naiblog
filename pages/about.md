# About

I am a passionate believer of love and loving what you do. I believe, to live means to seize each moment and hope for a better future, in the wake of all disaster around us. "What doesnâ€™t kill you makes you stronger." I write straight from the heart. From a point of reasoning with your reality without justifying the reasons for the current state of things but seeing that, the grass only gets greener when you work towards getting it green.

Love, laugh, live, learn and never stop dreaming!
