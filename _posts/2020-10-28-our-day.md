*On this day;*

   In your arms hold me tight,

   Like an acoustic guitar,

   Do not let go of me.

   Let the sound of the waves,

   Be music to our ears, 

   As we lay, on these sandy beach,

   Of our love.





 *Today;*

   As we celebrate our love,

   Give me a purple rose,

   A pink one too,

   And that will be enough,

   For as long as i got you,

   That will be enough.





*You;*

   Don't make the day shorter,

   But easy you make it,

   Faster the time seems to go,

   Whenever am with you,

   I wish time could slow down,

   So the moments grow longer

   As we enjoy, our love.





*Without you;*

   These day wouldn't be special,

   I would still, be stuck in the dark,

   For you, brought light into my life,

   You are the Yang to my Yin,

   And I celebrate us,

   On these day.
