>“Behind your screen are a thousand engineers using the world’s most powerful computers to try to get you to spend more time on your phone.”
–  Tristan Harris, Co-Founder, The Center for Humane Technology

Technology wizards have masterminded a new form of capitalism, and humanity is now the raw resource feeding the machine. Powerful, hidden artificial intelligence tasked with hijacking our attention is tearing apart social norms, jeopardizing truth and democracy, and putting civilization on a programmed path toward self-destruction.

As most of the world continues to be home-bound, Netflix has placed audiences in the ultimate social dilemma by streaming **The Social Dilemma**. This Docu series is the reason behind writing this article as it gives the invisible part of how technology is shaping the society.

Watching this as someone who studies the Internet and its intricacies offered up some pretty vivid flashbacks to the then-seemingly mundane theories and literary works in the form of now-confronting realities.
