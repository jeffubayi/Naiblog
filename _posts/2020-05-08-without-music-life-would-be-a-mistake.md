Music is the key to creativity. It helps you in improving your mind
vigorously by making it more artistic and ingenious. No matter, what the great invention is, it
requires art, creativity and imagination that is fulfilled by Music.

It enhances our comprehensive ability in terms of the message it conveys. 
When you hear a song, you try to understand its lyrics and try to make out
what the singer is saying through his song.

Music is an extremely unique way to develop the capability of memorising. The best example to
prove this sentence is, that you can easily learn songs rather than learning your syllabus. The
reason behind learning a song quickly is that your mind enjoys music.

Whatever your minds enjoy,
it preserves it.
Thus, music is said to be a good option to learn new things quickly. This is the only reason why you remember your favorite poems and songs throughout your life. These
days, even the schools realize the importance of music, hence they are enhancing the methods of
teaching by making it interesting with the help of music.

### Music makes you express your emotion

When you play some instrument, then you usually play the music that reflects our thoughts or our
emotions. This way your brain convey the thoughts with the medium of music, without speaking a
word. When we try to understand the music,it makes our mind more
creative.

### Conclusion
Whatever I'm going through in life there is a song that fits too well. Lyrics
hit home like the song was written just for me and my situation. And then
there's music that makes you feel good, makes you wanna dance, and makes
you wanna run or pumps you up to workout. I listen to everything and don't
judge anyone on what they listen to. You like trap music, that's cool, I can
vibe with that. You like gangsta rap, that's cool too. You like Lil Wayne,
that's coolâ€”I think you have horrible taste in music, but that's still cool.

>No matter what your situation is, there is definitely a song out there that'll
help you get through it. All you gotta do is just open up your music app and find a playlist
that fits you
