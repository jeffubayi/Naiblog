Fear is only an emotion, it can be stopped by action.

The words that creep up on you in that moment of uncertainty,that cause
 hesitation.
The insecurity brought about by the fear of what they will think ,or what
they will say!

Alone in silence where your own thoughts bring you down.
The words that keep you from moving forward.
The inability to try because there is always a reason not to.......
1000 ways to die ,1000 ways to try .
How about you spend more time trying .Than looking at the 1000 ways
you will die.
It means much more to die trying, than to be average.

Everyone has a fear. The only thing that separates us is that some of us will go to our grave and will be buried with our fears and others will concur them and live a life without
boundaries.
 Use fear as a motivating factor and chase the thrill of outdoing it .

Overcome each challenge knowing, What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.
It is in realizing that you might have been wrong in thinking that it was a mountain when it was only an illusion.

The reward is always in the risk.
Fear is poison and i am confronting mine .What are you waiting for?
